    "### For this project we will take data “Collisions-All Years” from Seattle Department of Traffic (SDOT). This data set contains all types of collisions. Collisions will display at the intersection or mid-block of a segment. Timeframe for this dataset is from 2004. The dataset is downloaded from below link:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Important attributes of dataset that will be used to make the Machine Learning model can be understood as below:\n",
    "1.\tSEVERITYCODE: A code that corresponds to the severity of the collision: 1 is for Property Damage & 2 is for Injury.\n",
    "2.\tUNDERINFL: Whether a driver involved was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It is categorical variable and states Y & N for being under an influence or not respectively.\n",
    "3.\tWEATHER: A description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision. It is also a categorical variable with different weather conditions like \n",
    "4.\tROADCOND: The condition of the road during the collision. It is also a categorical variable with different road conditions like Dry, Oily, Sand/ Mud/ Dirt, Snow, Wet, Standing Water.\n",
    "5.\tLIGHTCOND: The light conditions during the collision. It is also a categorical variable with different light conditions like Dark-No Street Light, Dar-Street Light Off, Dark-Street Light On, Dawn, Daylight, Dusk etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "### There are other attributes as well which majorly defines post accident data points like place where accident took place, data & time, number of persons got injured etc. which were not relevant for making the model.\n"
